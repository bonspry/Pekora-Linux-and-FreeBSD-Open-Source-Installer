# Pekora-Linux-and-FreeBSD-Open-Source-Installer
A Pekora Installer for Linux and FreeBSD made in sh.

This Pekora Installer is an open source installer for Pekora. Works on Linux and FreeBSD, might also work on NetBSD but i didn't add support for it in wine installer part of the script. Feel free to add it if you want to and know how.
